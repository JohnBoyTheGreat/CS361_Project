# CS361_Project

These are instructions for my project in CS361 Software Engineering 1 at Oregon State University, Spring of 2023.

The project is to develop a microservice to share with a team partner.

However, this is a stub at the moment, since my partner left to create an individual project and I have had to start from scratch. This will be updated as soon as I have a working microservice for my project.
